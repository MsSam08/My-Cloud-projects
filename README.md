Practical cloud engineering projects leveraging AWS ( From Beginner to Advanced).

# 1. AWS Billing Alerts Project

This project demonstrates how to configure **AWS CloudWatch Billing Alarms** and integrate them with **Amazon SNS** for real-time cost monitoring.  
I set up three billing alerts at different thresholds (**$5**, **$25**, and **$100**) to track spending and prevent unexpected charges.

The alarms were configured to send **email notifications** through an SNS topic, and their functionality was verified using a **test alarm state**.  
This project showcases practical AWS cost-management techniques using native monitoring and notification tools.
