Practical cloud engineering projects leveraging AWS ( From Beginner to Advanced).

# 1. AWS Billing Alerts Project

This project demonstrates how to configure **AWS CloudWatch Billing Alarms** and integrate them with **Amazon SNS** for real-time cost monitoring.  
I set up three billing alerts at different thresholds (**$5**, **$25**, and **$100**) to track spending and prevent unexpected charges.

The alarms were configured to send **email notifications** through an SNS topic, and their functionality was verified using a **test alarm state**.  
This project showcases practical AWS cost-management techniques using native monitoring and notification tools.

**Level:** Beginner

 # 2. AWS CLI MySQL RDS Project

This project demonstrates deploying a **MySQL database on Amazon RDS** entirely via the **AWS CLI**.  
It covers **subnet and security group setup**, **database provisioning**, and **connecting from local clients**.  
The project highlights **cloud automation, infrastructure-as-code, and practical RDS management** skills.

**Level:** Beginner → Intermediate

# 3. AWS CloudFormation Project

This project demonstrates deploying AWS resources automatically using **AWS CloudFormation**, a service that enables **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.  
The stack provisions an **Amazon S3 bucket** and a **DynamoDB table**, showcasing how to manage cloud infrastructure declaratively rather than manually.  
After deployment, the stack is deleted to confirm CloudFormation’s ability to fully automate both **creation** and **cleanup**.

**Level:** Beginner → Intermediate

# 4. AWS Auto Scaling Project

This project demonstrates **auto scaling EC2 instances** on AWS using Auto Scaling Groups and Launch Templates.  
It showcases how to dynamically adjust the number of EC2 instances based on demand, ensuring high availability and cost efficiency.  
The project also includes monitoring via Amazon CloudWatch to trigger scaling policies automatically.

**Level:** Beginner → Intermediate  
**Category:** AWS Cloud Engineering | Auto scaling groups | Launch Template
